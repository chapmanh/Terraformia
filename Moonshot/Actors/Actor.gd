extends KinematicBody2D
class_name Actor

# Actor = Entity in the game. All entities inhert from Actor
# This allows for easy global cahnges that afect every intance of 
# every entity (More useful in true physics games, but good practice)

# eg. with 
#const FLOOR_NORMAL: = Vector2.UP
#export var speed_2: = Vector2(300.0, 1000.0)
#export var gravity: = 4000.0

#var _velocity: = Vector2.ZERO
