# Terraformia

## A game developed for the Game Off 2020.

In the year 2042, humanity is expanding throughout the Earthâ€™s solar system in an effort to fight its overpopulation problem. But where to start? All the top scientists agreed on one plan: terraform the moon! 

Well, might as well get on with it. What could go wrong?

Using your spaceship, travel over the entire surface of the moon and plant the seeds you are carrying over from Earth while avoiding - or better still destroying - the meteorites that come at you.

We developed this game for the Game Off 2020 fuelled by our passion for classic run and gun arcades. 

Since this is our first game ever as a team, we would deeply appreciate any feedback in the comments!
